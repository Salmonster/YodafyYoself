There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Yoda-fy Yo'Self!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Turn your speech into Yoda-speak in anticipation of the latest Star Wars release.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Sometimes to get in the spirit of a special event, it's fun to impersonate an iconic character from the story that the event is based on. For example, around Christmas time people dress up like Santa Claus. Around the time of Star Wars movie releases, people dress up like their favorite Star Wars character. This app lets fans of Yoda discover how he would say otherwise normal English speech patterns to help them in their impersonations or just for the fun of discovering.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Anyone unfamiliar with the character Yoda who wishes to learn his speech style, either to impersonate him or just to become familiar with his persona, can use the app to help bridge the gap in understanding between themselves and diehard Yoda fans.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  A user can simply type in whatever they wish Yoda to say and submit their text to the app. Within a few seconds, the page will then render a translated version of the speech they entered.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "Speak like Yoda you will, with our fun new Yoda-fy app!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Simply load the webpage and type the text you desire to see translated into Yoda-speech in the text input field and submit by clicking the button or hitting enter.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "I was going around trying to hypothetically quote Yoda like I knew the movie franchise well, but I sounded ridiculous. With the 'Yoda-fy Yo'Self' app, I now know exactly what Yoda would say and I impress my Star Wars fan-friends with my impersonations!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  The app is still in development phase but has basic functionality. Simply load the html file into your browser. The API connection should be live and should give you the output you're looking for.
