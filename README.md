# YodafyYoself

Mithril version deployed at https://yodafy-yoself.herokuapp.com .

jQuery version deployed at https://salmonster.github.io/YodafyYoself .

The Chrome Speech Synthesis API has not been consistent with its offering of voices so the app no longer sounds like Yoda
and unfortunately I've not found a workable replacement.
